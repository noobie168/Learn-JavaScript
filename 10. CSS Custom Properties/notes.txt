1. CSS variables can be used using Sass and native variables.
2. Native custom properties syntax is wierd and can be accessed from JS as it does not need to be compiled.
3. It is not supported on all browsers except with IE.
4. Preprocessers like Sass can do much more things than Native Variables.
5. :root {} --> Any variable defined in root will have a global scope.
6. calc(var(--grid-gap) * 1px) --> It resolves the number to pixel values.
